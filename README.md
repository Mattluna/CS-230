# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room which currently had a game called Draw it or Lose It which is only android compatibility. The client wanted to expand their games compatibility to other platforms. They was more looking into a web design so the application could be accessed by many different OS.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think what I did best with this documentation is the "Recommendation" part of the whole thing. I was able to identify what would be best for the application and any security functions that would be necessary for ensuring a secure application.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

To me the document help keep thing and ideas organized which can be an issue when working on larger programs or projects. Most solo development are attempted without some form of document which normally leads to never being finishing the project.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part of the document that I need to fix or improve will be the "Design Constraints" as I didnt achive the clearity or what the goal was. The best way to impove it would be to use feedback that was provided and any research on the topic to help get a better idea on how to achive what was wanted.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs are very important because without the users then the application would be useless. When creating the application that focus on user interaction is important to separate the applications needs and the users needs so all topics would be covered in the design. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The technique that I would use in the future is to make sure all designs of an application is put into a documentation and even use UML diagrams to help outline the function of the application and the relationship of all parts of it. This will help me keep thing organized and easy to go through when working on software which can help my own efficiency.
